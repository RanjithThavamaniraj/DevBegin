# DevBegin
This is a Repository for all the beginners to get to know all the stuff about Dev Ops. Ofcourse Iam new to DevOps as well. Would Like to use this as a social platform to learn more about Development and Operations. 
Feel free to add all the stuff you learn about DevOps.

DevOps is a new term emerging from the collision of two major related trends. The first was also called agile system administration which came from applying newer Agile and Lean approaches to operations work.
